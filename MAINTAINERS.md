# Maintainers

This file lists how the `omnibus` project is maintained.

When making changes to the system, you need two maintainers to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out [How Chef is Maintained](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained) for details on the process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.
